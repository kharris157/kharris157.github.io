### Yoga has been apart of my life since approximately around the age of twelve. After joining the military yoga became more apart of my daily routine. Yoga has helped me manage stress, back pain, sleeping problems, and the inability to concentrate. Yoga has been very effective in helping me with coping skills and has been a big part of my daily practice of self care. 

### Yoga isnt just for relaxing it can also be great for fitness. It builds muscle strenghth, protecting us from conditions like arthritis and back pain. And when you build strength through yoga, you balance it with flexibility. Yoga’s incorporation of meditation and breathing can help improve a person’s mental well-being. Regular yoga practice creates mental clarity and calmness; increases body awareness; relieves chronic stress patterns; relaxes the mind; centers attention; perfects posture; boost immune system; lowers blood sugar and blood pressure; prevents digestive problems etc. etc.

### I know we've all heard of the sterotype that yoga is only for women but in all honesty more men are practicing yoga in the 21st century at an increasing rate. Id like to think its mainly because men are able to show a more sensitive side without much judgement now than a decade ago along with the highlight of couples yoga.
